# Lab 3
## Introduction
For lab 3, I used used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a proportional sybol map and a choropleth map. The proportional symbols represent the Covid cases in 2020 of specific counties. The colors on the choropleth map represent the rates.

## Map Comparison

The COVID-19 case/death data used is originally from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv). The data include all the cases in 2020. The population data used for calculating the case rates are from the [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). Both data are at the county level. These maps serve to provide a general pattern of where the virus had its highest effect on the residents.
